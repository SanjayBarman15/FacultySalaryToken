## Vision

The **FacultySalaryToken** project aims to enhance the management and distribution of faculty salaries through blockchain technology. By tokenizing salaries and integrating staking rewards, we provide a transparent and efficient system. This project is designed to streamline salary payments and offer additional benefits to faculty members, promoting a decentralized and modern approach to salary management.

## Features ✨

- **💸 Tokenized Salaries**: Faculty salaries are distributed as tokens.
- **🔒 Staking Rewards**: Faculty can stake tokens to earn rewards over time.
- **🛡️ Secure & Transparent**: Transactions occur on a secure and transparent blockchain.
- **⚙️ Automated Distribution**: Salaries are automatically distributed by the contract.
- **🌐 Decentralized Control**: Faculty manage their tokens autonomously.
